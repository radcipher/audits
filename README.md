# Radcipher â€” Web3 Security, Reimagined

Welcome to Radcipher, a next-gen Web3 security firm focused on protecting decentralized ecosystems through deep auditing, real-world exploit case studies, and cutting-edge security tools.

We combine top-tier smart contract auditing with educational products like **Audit Vault** â€” built for both developers and security researchers.

## About us
Weâ€™re a team of seasoned smart contract researchers committed to setting the standard in blockchain security. With multiple top-tier finishes on Code4rena, CodeHawks, Cantina, Sherlock and a proven track record of identifying high, medium and low -severity vulnerabilities across 20+ audits, we aim to lead the space through precision, expertise, and impact.
