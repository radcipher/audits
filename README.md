# 🛡️ Radcipher — Web3 Security, Reimagined

Welcome to Radcipher, a next-gen Web3 security firm focused on protecting decentralized ecosystems through deep auditing, real-world exploit case studies, and cutting-edge security tools.

We combine top-tier smart contract auditing with educational products like **Audit Vault** — built for both developers and security researchers.

## 🚀 What We're Building

### Audit Vault (Launching Soon)  
A private vault of exploit playbooks, bug case studies, audit tactics & pattern drills — learn how real exploits work and how to spot them before they hit mainnet.

### Security Audits  
Tailored smart contract audits for DeFi, NFT, and infrastructure protocols. Not just vulnerability reports — but actionable insight, strategic recommendations, and protocol hardening.

### Tools for Auditors (Coming Soon)  
We're building internal tools that speed up auditing, surface hidden attack surfaces, and make detection smarter — eventually releasing versions for the community.
