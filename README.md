## 🚀 About Me

I’m actively growing my skills in the intersection of **Web3**, **Blockchain**, and **Security**. My focus is on building secure decentralized applications (dApps) and conducting thorough security audits for smart contracts. I am constantly learning and refining my understanding of this rapidly evolving field, dedicating my time to security audits, contract analysis, and vulnerability assessments.

### **Current Focus Areas:**
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Reviewing Solidity code and contracts for security vulnerabilities.
- **Web3 Development**: Deepening my skills in decentralized application (dApp) development.
- **Security**: Specializing in identifying and mitigating risks in Web3 environments.

## 🔒 Web3 Security Audits

I’ve recently undertaken a few security audits on Web3 projects, identifying vulnerabilities and providing recommendations for remediation. Here are some key details:

### **Recent Security Audit**
- **Time Spent**: ~2.5 hours
- **Team**: Worked alongside a lead security researcher.
- **Focus**: We analyzed the Solidity code, focusing specifically on **security vulnerabilities**.
- **Outcome**: A detailed report was prepared, which outlines our findings and the security posture of the contracts.

### **Disclaimer**: 
While every effort was made to identify vulnerabilities within the given time frame, please note that these audits are not an endorsement of the underlying product or business. The scope was strictly time-boxed and concentrated on security aspects only.

## 🛠️ Projects & Tools

- **PasswordStore Protocol**: A protocol designed for securely storing and retrieving a user’s passwords. It is built for single-user usage and emphasizes secure access controls.

- **Security Audits**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning and analysis for Web3 projects.
